Description: To study network evolution models and different blockmodeling approaches. Various functions enable generating (temporal) networks with a selected blockmodel type, taking into account selected local network mechanisms. The development of this package is financially supported the Slovenian Research Agency (www.arrs.gov.si) within the research program P5<96>0168 and the research project J5-2557 (Comparison and evaluation of different approaches to blockmodeling dynamic networks by simulations with application to Slovenian co-authorship networks).
